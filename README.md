# Weather-Dashboard

## Motivation
This was my first opportunity to get a good look at third-party APIs. OpenWeather's API is very well documented and has lots of parameters to specify the request. I found myself doing extra work in the code and then realized, at times, I could modify the parameters to simplify the process. I learned so much about building this application - and not just with APIs. I created a lot more code dynamically than I have done previously and became more comfortable with JS functionality.

## The Task
Utilize a third-party API to make requests with specific parameters to a URL to retrieve data from another application's API and use it in my own context. In this case, I was tasked to use the data to build a weather dashboard that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and Local Storage to store persistent data. 

## User Story
Provided by University of Denver Coding BootCamp:
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
## Acceptance Criteria
Provided by University of Denver Coding BootCamp:
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
